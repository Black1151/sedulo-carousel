## Welcome to my beautful carousel!

The carousel is implemented using atomic design priciples as requested, so the carousel molecule can actually be used without its parent which handles the changing background if needs be. Code is modular and clean, adhering to best practices and DRY principles. Whole thing is completely bespoke and written using Chakra UI components and animation techniques.

I hope you guys have as much fun messing with it as I had making it!

## Features

Fully mobile responsive down to about 280px so will display properly even on a very small phone.

Changes in layout with window size changes happen smoothly and gracefully.

Backgound fades to the next image when clicked.

Information flyout apears with details of the selected app and a button, you might recognise the font and colour on the button from your website/brand.

Carousel has nicely animated buttons which pop up when pressed and react to holding the mouse down.

The centre app on the carousel is currently selected, user can select the app by clicking on the visible icons or using the dots at the bottom.

## Getting started

As this is a demo it is just set up to run in dev mode so a good old "npm run dev" in the project root will launch the app which can be accessed by going to localhost:3000 in the browser.
